## Overview

Noted ("the App") is a simple, private notes application developed by Ryan. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains how we handle your information.

## Information We Collect

**We collect ZERO personal information.**

The App does not collect, transmit, or share any of your personal data. All notes you create are stored exclusively on your device.

### What Data is Stored Locally

- **Your Notes:** All note content, titles, and formatting are stored locally on your device using Android's SharedPreferences
- **Timestamps:** Creation and modification dates for organizing your notes
- **Tags:** Optional tags you add to notes for organization
- **Folders:** Custom archive folders you create
- **Photos:** Images you attach to notes are stored locally in the app's private storage
- **Reminders:** Reminder times you set for notes are stored locally on your device
- **App Preferences:** Theme settings, font choices, and other app configurations

### What Data is NOT Collected

- No personal information
- No email addresses
- No phone numbers
- No location data
- No analytics or tracking
- No advertising identifiers
- No usage statistics
- No crash reports

## Data Storage

### Local Storage Only

All your notes are stored **exclusively on your device** using Android's secure SharedPreferences system. Your data never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to export it.

### Backup & Export

The App includes optional backup functionality:

- **Manual Export:** You can export your notes to a JSON file at a location of your choice
- **Your Control:** You decide when and where to save backup files
- **No Cloud Sync:** Backups are not automatically uploaded anywhere
- **Your Responsibility:** You control where exported files are stored (Downloads, Google Drive, etc.)

When you export notes:
- A JSON file is created containing your note data
- You choose the save location using Android's file picker
- The file remains under your control
- We never see, access, or store your exported files

## Third-Party Services

**We use NO third-party services.** The App does not integrate with:

- Analytics services (Google Analytics, Firebase, etc.)
- Advertising networks
- Cloud storage providers (unless you manually save there)
- Social media platforms
- Crash reporting services

## Permissions

The App requests only the permissions necessary for specific features you choose to use:

- **No Internet Permission** - The app cannot access the internet
- **No Location Permission** - We never access your location
- **No Contacts Access** - We don't read your contacts

### Optional Permissions (only when you use the feature)

- **Camera** - Only used when you choose to take a photo to attach to a note
- **Photo Gallery Access** - Only used when you choose to attach an existing photo to a note
- **Notifications** - Only used to deliver reminders you set for your notes
- **Alarms & Reminders** - Only used to schedule reminder notifications at times you specify

### Storage Access Framework

The App uses Android's modern Storage Access Framework (SAF) for backup/restore:
- You choose files and locations through Android's system UI
- No broad storage access required
- You maintain full control over your files

### Photos

When you attach photos to notes:
- Photos are copied to the app's private storage on your device
- Original photos in your gallery are not modified
- Photos are only accessed when you explicitly choose to add them
- Photos are included in backups if you export your notes
- Photos are deleted when you delete the associated note or uninstall the app

### Reminders

When you set reminders for notes:
- Reminder times are stored locally on your device
- Notifications are delivered through Android's system
- No reminder data is sent to external servers
- Reminders are rescheduled automatically after device restart

## Data Security

### How Your Data is Protected

- **Local Only:** Data never leaves your device (except when you explicitly export)
- **No Network Access:** The app cannot connect to the internet
- **Android Security:** Protected by your device's built-in security (encryption, lock screen, etc.)
- **No Backdoors:** We have no way to access your notes

### Your Responsibility

Since notes are stored locally:
- **Device Security:** Keep your device protected with a lock screen
- **Regular Backups:** Use the export feature to back up important notes
- **Uninstall Warning:** Uninstalling the app will delete all notes unless you export them first

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect information from anyone, including children under 13. Since we collect zero data, the app is safe for all ages.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted in the app and on our distribution page with an updated "Last Updated" date.

## Data Retention and Deletion

### How Long We Keep Data

We don't keep any data because we don't collect any data. All notes are stored locally on your device.

### How to Delete Your Data

To delete all your notes and app data:

1. **In-App:** Delete notes individually by swiping left
2. **Android Settings:** Go to Settings → Apps → Noted → Storage → Clear Data
3. **Uninstall:** Uninstalling the app removes all data

**Important:** Deleting app data or uninstalling removes all notes permanently unless you've exported a backup.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect any personal data, typical data rights (access, correction, deletion, portability) are not applicable. However:

- **You own your data** - All notes belong to you
- **Full control** - You can export, delete, or modify notes anytime
- **No tracking** - We never track your usage
- **No profiling** - We don't build profiles or analyze behavior

## International Users

The App works the same way worldwide. Since no data is collected or transmitted, there are no cross-border data transfer concerns.
